# AWS Hands-On Lab: Identity and Access Management (IAM)

## 📌 Overview  
This repository documents my AWS hands-on lab journey using Whizlabs.  
The purpose of this series is to practice, recap, and showcase AWS concepts I’ve been learning.  

This first lab focused on Identity and Access Management (IAM) — a foundational service in AWS for managing users, groups, and permissions securely.  


## 🛠️ Lab Tasks  
1. Signed into the AWS Management Console  
2. Created IAM Users  
3. Created IAM Groups  
4. Validated the lab setup  

## 📸 Screenshots  
(Screenshots are uploaded in the `/screenshots` folder)

## 🎯 Key Learnings  
- IAM enforces the principle of least privilege by assigning only the permissions needed.  
- Users represent individual identities, while groups allow permission management at scale.  
- Proper IAM configuration is critical for security and compliance in AWS environments.
